		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>
			In this lab, you will run a pre-built app to see when each of the 5 <code>MotionEventActions</code> enum values
			are reported for multi-touch. There is no code to write in this exercise.
		</p>

		<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

		<h2>Required assets</h2>
		<p>
			You will need the solution contained in the <strong>Completed</strong> Resources folder for this part.
		</p>

		<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

		<h1>Steps</h1>
		<p>
			Below are the step-by-step instructions for the exercise.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Locate the Resources folder for this part.
				Open the <strong>MultiTouchActionsTest</strong> solution in the <strong>Completed</strong> folder.
			</li>

			<li>
				Run the app. A physical device is best for this; however, any emulator that lets you simulate more
				than one touch point will work (e.g. the Xamarin Android Player).
			</li>

			<li>
				The UI will be empty when you first launch the app. As you touch the screen, the app will add entries to
				a <code>ListView</code>. The list entries show you the value of <code>ActionMasked</code> and the current
				number of touch points as each event occurs.
			</li>

			<li>
				Touch and release with a single finger. You should see two list entries showing you a
				<code>Down</code> action followed by an <code>Up</code> action. If you dragged your finger
				across the surface, you may also see a few <code>Move</code> actions. In all cases, you should
				see that only 1 pointer is currently in contact with the screen.
				The <code>Down</code> and <code>Up</code> actions report first-finger-down and last-finger-up
				so they are exactly what you should see for single-touch.
			</li>

			<li>
				Click the button in the upper-right corner of the UI (in the Action Bar). This will
				clear the content of the <code>ListView</code>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Touch with a single finger. Touch with a second finger. Release with one finger. Release with
				the other finger. You should see the sequence: <code>Down</code>, <code>PointerDown</code>,
				<code>PointerUp</code>, and <code>Up</code>. The pointer count should match the number of
				fingers you have touching the screen at each step. If you are using the Xamarin Android Player,
				hold down the Alt/Option key and then click to simulate two-finger-touch (you may have to
				drag your finger a little bit to get the emulator to report the second touch).
			</li>

			<li>
				If you are using a physical device, you can experiment with more than two fingers;
				however, please keep in mind that the <code>ListView</code> will quickly run out of
				screen space to display the output.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

		<h1>Summary</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise let you verify the <code>MotionEventActions</code> that Android reports for multi-touch.
				Your app receives <code>Down</code> when the first finger touches the screen, <code>PointerDown</code>
				for each additional finger, <code>PointerUp</code> when non-primary fingers leave the screen, and finally
				<code>Up</code> when the use removes the last finger.
